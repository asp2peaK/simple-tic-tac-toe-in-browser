# simple-tic-tac-toe-in-browser
Tic-Tac-Toe game in the browser.

Version 2.0 update has been released for my simple website, where you can play Tic-Tac-Toe.

Added:
+ Play with a friend button. Now you can play by entering names for more comfort.
+ Play with a bot button is currently unavailable, indicating future updates.

Changed:
+ Site color, fonts, and element positioning.

Actually, for some reason, I thought I added more than necessary to make it a true 2.0 update, but after writing the text, I realized that's not the case, haha.

There are probably unnecessary elements in the code as well, so I'll gradually get rid of them. Thank you for your attention!
